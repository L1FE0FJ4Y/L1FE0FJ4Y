### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
### I am currently a senior at the University of Oregon majoring in Computer Science âœ¨
### I have a great interest in how to make various computation easily accessible in everyday life. I am interested in Cloud and High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence, because I believe combination of two would be the leading frame of next computing paradigm. A goal of mine is to develop an application that uses AI/ML to contribute effective management of nutrition status for the people. ðŸ˜„
